# Who am I ?

I work at a SIP/VoIP carrier in Switzerland. I'm managing the typical infrastructure, such as our networks and servers. But also deeply involved with the VoIP side of things : designing call-flows and implementing them in several PBX systems, or analyzing SIP traces and troubleshooting root causes for bad call quality or outages between carriers or end-user phones.

You'll find here my thoughts and articles about my current work in systems & network engineering and maybe some development.
Thanks for being here !
