# CCNA Completed !
On January 9th, I took the train to Geneva for my appointment at a PearsonVue testing center for my ICND2 exam.
This exam was the second *module* required to complete the CCNA Routing & Switching certification.

It was about 1.5 hour long and it kicked my ass during the whole session.
I wasn't sure at all of my answers and I got several topics which I didn't really studied nor got exposed to in my daily job.
But in the end, I passed it with a great score of 930+ (811 to pass) !

I'm not sure yet if I'll continue in my Cisco training as the new CCNP looks pretty hard and is testing lots of technologies which I'm not involved with at work.

We'll see...
